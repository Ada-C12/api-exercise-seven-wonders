# API Exercise: Seven Wonders of the World

You are planning a trip to see all seven wonders of the world! How exciting! And now you need to plan your trip, using the coordinates of all seven wonders. Being a developer, why do this yourself when you can have a computer do it for you?!  

Using the list of all the wonders, make a collection of all their coordinates using httparty and Location IQ's API.

**Use this:**
```ruby
seven_wonders = ["Great Pyramid of Giza", "Babylon", "Colossus of Rhodes", "Pharos of Alexandria", "Statue of Zeus at Olympia", "Temple of Artemis", "Mausoleum at Halicarnassus"]
```

**To Generate this:**
```ruby
{"Great Pyramid of Giza"=>{"lat"=>29.9792345, "lng"=>31.1342019}, "Babylon"=>{"lat"=>32.5422374, "lng"=>44.42103609999999}, "Colossus of Rhodes"=>{"lat"=>36.45106560000001, "lng"=>28.2258333}, "Pharos of Alexandria"=>{"lat"=>38.7904054, "lng"=>-77.040581}, "Statue of Zeus at Olympia"=>{"lat"=>37.6379375, "lng"=>21.6302601}, "Temple of Artemis"=>{"lat"=>37.9498715, "lng"=>27.3633807}, "Mausoleum at Halicarnassus"=>{"lat"=>37.038132, "lng"=>27.4243849}}
```

The first part of this challenge will be figuring out how to look up a site's location. How will you find the very specific api request needed to obtain the necessary data, based only on the information provided in the seven_wonders array?  Hint: **You will need an API key,** and you can request an API key from [Location IQ](https://locationiq.com/).  It's free!

The second part will be understanding how to interact with the response data to target the specific parts needed to get the result we want.

**Instructions:**
- Fork and clone this repository.
- Open the provided ruby file, `seven_wonders.rb`.
- Use your developer skills to adventure through Google searches and the [Location IQ's documentation](https://locationiq.com/docs) to discover how to request the location of all the great wonders.

**Word of Warning** The free API is "rate-limited" this means that you can only make so many API calls a second.  You will need to pause your program between requests.  You can do so with `sleep(1)`, which will pause your application for 1 second.  

## Optional Enhancement

For an optional enhancement try to:

- Make a request for driving directions from Cairo Egypt to the Great Pyramid of Giza.  
- Turn these locations into the names of places: [{ lat: 38.8976998, lon: -77.0365534886228}, {lat: 48.4283182, lon: -123.3649533 }, { lat: 41.8902614, lon: 12.493087103595503}]



Safe travels!
